STM32F401RE Showcase Project Plan



Goal: Build a polished, interview-ready embedded systems demo on the Nucleo-F401RE board that exercises a broad range of MCU peripherals and good engineering practices (architecture, documentation, version control, testing, demo script). Use the BMP280 environmental sensor (temp + pressure) plus a small set of low-cost components (LEDs, pushbuttons, potentiometer, maybe buzzer or small fan) to create a Smart Environmental Node you can extend with data logging, alerts, and optional Edge/ML hooks.
